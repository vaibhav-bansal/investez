This gives you a comprehensive snapshot of the company's current status.\n\nThe data you see is real-time or very recent (within the last few hours/days), so you get current information rather than outdated numbers. This helps you make informed decisions based on the latest available information about any Indian stock or mutual fund.\n\nIs there any specific aspect of Reliance's data you'd like me to explain further?",

I'm here to help you research and learn about investments.\n\nWould you like to continue analyzing Reliance or look at any other stock/investment topic?",
