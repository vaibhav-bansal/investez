/* ABOUT */
  InvestEz solves two critical problems for Indian retail investors:

  1. Portfolio Consolidation - Your investments are scattered across multiple
     brokers (Zerodha, Groww, Upstox, etc.). InvestEz brings everything together
     in one unified dashboard. See all your stocks, mutual funds, and portfolios
     in one place. No more switching between apps.

  2. AI-Powered Research - Investment research is complex and jargon-heavy.
     InvestEz provides plain-language AI analysis and insights. Ask questions
     about your investments and get instant, easy-to-understand answers.

  Features:
  - Multi-broker portfolio consolidation
  - Unified investment dashboard
  - Real-time sync across platforms
